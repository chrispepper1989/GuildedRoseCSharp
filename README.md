# Gilded Rose

This is the Gilded Rose kata in C#.

# How to run
Open the solution file and run the tests :) 

# General approach

For this I used a combination of the library "Approval" to write comprehensive tests before i began.

Then using NCrunch as my code coverate / test runner, I simply moved code in undestructive ways and then deleted dead code paths. I repeated this until the code was more functional and easier to understand, then I made what I felt were readability / maintainability improvements

# TODO
Finish the more functional approach (on a branch at the moment)
